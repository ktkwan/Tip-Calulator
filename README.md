Tip Calculator 

# Project 1 - *Tips Calculator*

**Tips Calculator**

Submitted by: **Katie Kwan**

Time spent: **4** 

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [X] Settings page to change the default tip percentage (partially)
* [] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.


The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] I added a double tax segment 
- [X] a dollar sign, tax label and total label that disappears after the user starts typing

## Notes

I could not figure out for a while why my text size and style was not changing, which took up a lot of my time. However, I ended up creating a new text box and making the connections again. Also, I did not have enough time to complete the default setting, but I did make a settings page.
